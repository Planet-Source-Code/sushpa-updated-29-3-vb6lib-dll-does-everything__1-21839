-------------
1. OVERVIEW
-------------
This DLL has been created using Visual Basic 6.0. This version of VB
has some new functions, which are probably not available in earlier
versions. This DLL contains functions that may be used by both VB 5.0
and VB6 to enhance the interface as well as the functionality of your
projects. You can add wonderful proffesionalism to your applications
with this DLL by using the many modules it has. You can play MP3 and
WAV files, encrypt and decrypt text, manipulate strings, Create graphics
effects and do more. The Total version like the previous includes all the 9
modules - Strings, API, Interaction, Sounds, Network, Menus, Graphics,
General, and Registry. The ReadValue() and SaveValue() functions are in
the Strings module although it is planned to move them in the Registry
module probably in the next release. This only includes the VB6LIB.DLL;
it does not  have the files for the other DLLs. Please check with the page
http://sushantshome.tripod.com/vb/vb6lib.html for more information.

--------------
2. NOTES/INFO
--------------
The DLL being referred to is not actually readily supplied for various
reasons (it being a binary file), some of which are:

      a) For fear of viruses while in transit through the web and
      b) To considerably decrease the file size of the ZIP file.

Please bear with me for the inconvenience if any. The DLL files as well
as the EXP and LIB files can be created by using the 'Make DLL' command
in Visual Basic. The EXP and LIBs are constructed automatically in this
process.

---------------
3. REFERENCING
---------------
You can add this DLL to your projects by using the 'References' command.
Browse for the DLL and set it there. This release does not contain the split
up DLLs (one each of the particular modules). You can reference the
Main DLL which contains all the modules.

------------------
4. THIS VERSION
------------------
As described above, this version contains the main DLL project only. In the
Total version, You can simply use the modules you want without the need to 
reference the other modules. This version is 2.01.044. Please be sure to send 
comments and feedback at sushant@phreaker.net or http://sushantshome.tripod.com.

-----------------
5. RESTRICTIONS
-----------------
You are not given any restrictions for the usage of this code except
for the inclusion of it in commercial projects, where permission from
me would be required (or atleast the inclusion be brought to my notice).
If you appreciate the work put into the creation of these Libraries,
please include my name and if possible a link to my homepage or email
address in the credits section. This DLL may be used in all kinds of 
projects which are intended for FREE NON-PROFIT distribution.

------------
6. SIGNOFF
------------
I was involved in developing major projects which didnt work out too well
and I'm sure you know what it felt like when I would've realized what I
had been doing was not paying off. That is why I decided to do something
that would help others like me to enhance their apps and never feel that
there is something that cannot be accomplished with good old VB. This and
a few ActiveX controls that I made have been put up on the many websites
on the internet in the hope that they will somehow be useful to someone.

==========================================================================

Please check out my other files:

 * Font Dialog ActiveX Control Module
 * Win32 Proccess Heap Viewer ActiveX Control
 * Splitting MDI Forms - A tutorial on MDIs
 * "Installer Magic" Installation Utility
 
These files are available on most of the internet websites that showcase
the work of us developers and programmers around the world.
